## About

This is a Mathematica package developed for an analysis of EEG and EKG records in depressed patients. The hypothesis is that there are associations between particular parts of the power spectra, which are physically coupled through renin-angiotensin system, among others. We examined this hypothesis by looking at the time-dependent power spectra of each sensor before and after therapy, and computing various correlation functions.
